## My Works


<div align="center">
  <h3>Web Development:</h3>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/Taihenc/YAKINIKU">Yakiniku</a></h3>
</div>

YAKINIKU is a website for learning about yakiniku. This site will provide you with a variety of cow breeds along with valuable information. It includes details about each cut, such as its origin and cooking recommendations. Additionally, we offer a mini-game for yakiniku enthusiasts where you can select a beef cut, read the cooking guide, start grilling, and receive a cooking result to gauge your skills.
